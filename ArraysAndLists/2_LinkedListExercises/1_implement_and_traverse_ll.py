2 - Extend the linked list
At this point, our linked list looks like this:

Our goal is to extend it until it looks like this:
2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 ->
To do this, we need to create three more nodes, and we need to attach each
one to the `next` attribute of the node that comes before it. Notice that we
don't have a direct reference to any of the nodes other than the `head` node!
See if you can write the code to finish creating the above list:
* Add three more nodes to the list, with the values `4`, `3`, and `5`

OK, great! We successfully created a simple linked list. But printing all the

Let's see how we might traverse the list and print all the values, no matter
how long it might be.
